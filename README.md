This repository contains the code for automating the CFD simulation tasks of ANSYS Watertight geometry meshing workflow and ANSYS Fluent solver using PyFluent Core, Parametric, and Visualization packages. 
The projects in these repository do not reflect on using CFD tool effectively or perform quality meshing. 
The aim is to develop codes for automating the CFD simulation tasks to save the valueable time in navigating through UI of commercial CFD software packages.
This was done with the goal of spending more time on the CFD result interpretation rather than performing simulations.
