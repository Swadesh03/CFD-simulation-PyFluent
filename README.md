This repository contains the code for automating the CFD simulation tasks of ANSYS Watertight geometry meshing workflow and ANSYS Fluent solver using PyFluent Core, Parametric, and Visualization packages. 
The projects in this repository do not reflect on using the CFD tool effectively or performing quality meshing. 
The aim is to develop codes for automating the CFD simulation tasks to save valuable time in navigating through the UI of commercial CFD software packages.
This was carried out to support the idea of spending more time on the CFD result interpretation rather than performing CFD simulations.
